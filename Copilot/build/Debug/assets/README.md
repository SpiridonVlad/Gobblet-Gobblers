# Game Assets

This folder contains assets required for the Gobblet Gobblers game.

## Required Files

### Font File
The game requires a font file named `font.ttf` in this directory.

To add a font:
1. Download any TTF font (suggested: [Roboto Regular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto))
2. Rename it to `font.ttf`
3. Place it in this `assets` directory

Without this font file, text rendering in the game will fail to initialize.
